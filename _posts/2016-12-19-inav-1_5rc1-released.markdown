I'm happy to announce release of first Release Candidate or INAV 1.5. 

Download binaries at [GitHub](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/releases/tag/1.5-RC1).
Please also update your INAV Configurator and carefully read release notes - many things changed (as usual).

Thanks for using INAV! Happy flying!
