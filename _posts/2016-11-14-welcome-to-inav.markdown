Welcome to INAV. Started in 2015 as a small hobby project for personal needs INAV grew into something bigger - an entry-level autopilot for R/C enthusiast community. 

Designed to run on a large variety of hardware it can fly almost anything that flies - from a small R/C airplane to a big hexacopter drone. While using a cheapest possible hardware it still offers a lot of cool features: 

 * Return to launch both by pilot command and R/C link loss
 * Hold position and altitude modes
 * Way-point autonomous flight
 * Flight stabilisation and guidance
 * INAV is also a perfect fit for a racing drone
 
Moreover, INAV is 100% open source, meaning you don't get any hidden or proprietary code there.
