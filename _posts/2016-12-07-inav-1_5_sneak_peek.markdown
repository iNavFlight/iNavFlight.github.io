Hi friends! 

Just wanted to share what's going on regarding development of INAV 1.5:

 * A nasty bug with GPS/Baro fusion is going to be nailed (again, I hope this will be a final fix).
 * OSD support for boards that have it (Airbot AIO boards).
 * I2C on Naze32 and other targets is going to be more reliable.
 * Low resolution resolution issue in ACRO mode is going to be fixed.
 * And as always, lots of minor bug fixes and clean ups.

Stay tuned for INAV 1.5 "Happy New Year" release! Happy flying!
