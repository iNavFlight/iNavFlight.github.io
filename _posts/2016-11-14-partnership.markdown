The project is the result of an immense amount of effort from software and hardware engineers, beta testers, web developers, documenters and many others.
Any number of individuals and companies are welcomed  to involve in the project. If you are an individual who want to support the development, please visit [supporting INAV](/supporting-inav) page instead.



## 1. "INAV Inside" logo program

This option is available free of charge for those who sell flight control boards pre-loaded with INAV or use INAV in their projects.

### Pros:

1. Show that your hardware is working on a solid multi-platform autopilot software
1. Option is available free of charge for all users of original INAV firmware



## 2. Partner program

Partner status is a way to express our gratitude to those who support INAV by donating $50 or more per month. Your company will be listed in Partners section of our website and also in Configurator tool. Partners are also welcome to discuss the future of INAV and related products.

There is an important note - partner status doesn't give your the right to influence INAV. While we consider what our partners want and need from INAV, we keep INAV entirely community-driven. You voice as a partner will be heard, but we can't guarantee that we'll act on it.

### Pros:

1. Warm feeling in your heart for helping a worthy project
1. Participate in future of the project and be heard


## 3. Certified Hardware program

If you sell hardware that is designed specifically  for INAV and you want to ensure that INAV is compatible with your hardware you have an option to get INAV development team involved under "INAV Certified Hardware" program.

### Pros:

1. Make sure that your hardware/project is supported by INAV
1. Receive support from directly from INAV development team

To exercise this option we ask for a minimum donation of $100 per month. If you prefer to pay upfront for a year it will cost you $1000. Money will be spent to set up the test platform and test each released stable version against your hardware to ensure all parts of your hardware are functional.

We also ask that you deliver your hardware to developers so they can do tests on it on regular basis.

Please contact us at mail@inavflight.com first to arrange this option if you are interested.
