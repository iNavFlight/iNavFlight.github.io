I'm happy to announce that [INAV 1.8-RC1](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/releases/tag/1.8-RC1) has been released. This is a release-candidate for upcoming version 1.8.

Note, that you'll need a new INAV Configurator which is available as a [Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inav-configurator/fmaidjmgkdkpafmbnmigkpdnpdhopgel?hl=en) or as a [standalone application for Windows or MacOS](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/tag/1.8.0)

Most notable changes in this version:

 * Heavily reworked OSD
 * SmartAudio and Trump VTX
 * Real date/time in OSD and logs (taken from GPS)
 * A number of smaller improvements
