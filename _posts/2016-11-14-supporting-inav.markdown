### Hi, I'm Konstantin Sharlaimov, the creator and main developer of INAV. Thanks for visiting this page.

As you can imagine, **working on INAV takes a lot of effort**. Development of new functionality, maintenance, bug fixing, testing, release preparations, 
reviews of contributed code and such is already a full time job when done right, and that even leaves out other tasks like writing documentation, community 
management etc. And that's not even counting for costs of hardware to test the code.

Don't get me wrong, **I really love improving INAV** and I want to continue doing it and be involved as much as possible! But it's hard to manage this 
ever growing project next to a paying full-time job. â€‹So now I'm asking for your help to allow me to stay involved with INAV as much as I am now!

You can **support INAV development** by [becoming a patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/inavflight) or [making a one-time contribution on Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/KonstantinSharlaimov).

Please note that **becoming a patron [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/inavflight) allows me to plan ahead**. Patreon also works through PayPal, you can opt out at any time, and on top of that you get access to some bonuses.
